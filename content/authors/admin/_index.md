I am a first year PhD student supervised by Professor James Stafford and Professor Patrick Brown. My research interests are mostly in Bayesian inference, statistical computations, and applications of statistical methods to solve interdisciplinary problems. Before coming to this program, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Statistics specialist also in UofT. 

Out of school, I like playing video games and watching soccer. I am a Manchester City fan and my favoriate player in the team is Sergio Aguero.
